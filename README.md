# My personal fork

I made this fork to add the commands I want to run on every terminal window and to do some tweaks
Probably I need to change some more things for this to work well

## 🎨 PowerShell Profile (Pretty PowerShell)

A stylish and functional PowerShell profile that looks and feels almost as good as a Linux terminal.

## ⚡ One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

```powershell
irm "https://github.com/timotofcourse/powershell-profile/raw/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

## 🛠️ Fix the Missing Font

If the icons bug out install a nerd font, like 'Hack' and set it on the terminal settings
   
## Customize this profile

**Do not make any changes to the `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file**, since it's hashed and automatically overwritten by any commits to this repository.

Edit the `profile.ps1` instead
